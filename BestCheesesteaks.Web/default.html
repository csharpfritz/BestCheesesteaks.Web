		<h2>How to Order</h2>
		
		<p>
			Do yourself a favor: learn how to order a sandwich like a local.  When you order a Philly Cheesesteak from a sandwich shop in town, don't make
			one of these common mistakes when ordering: 
			
			<ul>
				<li>Don't call it a "Philly" or a "Philadelphia", we know what it is: a cheesesteak</li>
				<li>Don't ask for it without cheese, that's almost sacrilege</li>
				<li>Don't ask for "lite" or "fat free".  You're ordering a cheesesteak, its got fat and it's not the healthiest.  If you want healthy, try a chicken cheesesteak instead.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Do use these keywords and
			you'll get a bit more respect from the staff:
			
			<ul>
				<li><b>Wit</b> Short for with Fried Onions</li>
				<li><b>WitOut</b> Short for without Fried Onions</li>
				<li><b>Whiz</b> Short for with Cheez Whiz</li>
				<li><b>American</b> Short for with American Cheese</li>
			</ul>
			
			... then you can mix and match these keywords and order simply:
			
			<ul>
				<li>Whiz Wit - A cheesesteak with cheez whiz and fried onions</li>
				<li>American Witout - A cheesesteak with just American cheez and beef</li>
			</ul>
